(1, 'Ngaben di Bali', '<p>Ngaben adalah upacara pembakaran jenazah umat HIndu di Bali.Upacara ngaben merupakan suatu ritual yang dilaksanakan untuk mengembalikan roh leluhur ke tempat asalnya.Ngaben dalam bahasaBali berkonotasi halus yang sering disebut palebon.Palebon berasal dari kata lebu yang artinya prathiwi atau tanah.Palebon artinya menjadikan prathiwi (abu).Untuk menjadikan tanah itu ada dua cara yaitu dengan cara membakar (ngaben) dan menanam ke dalam tanah (metanem).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tujuan upacara ngaben</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tujuan dari upacara ngaben adalah mempercepat ragha sarira agar dapat kembali ke asalnya,yaitu panca maha buthadi alam ini dan bagi atma dapat cepat menuju alam pitra.landasan filosofis ngaben secara umum adalah panca sradha yaitu lima kerangka dasar Agama Hindu yaitu Brahman, Atman, Karmaphala, Samsara dan Moksa. Sedangkan secara khusus ngaben dilaksanakan karena wujud cinta kepada para leluhur dan bhakti anak kepada orang tuanya.Upacara ngaben merupakan proses pengembalian unsur panca maha butha kepada Sang pencipta. Ngaben juga disebut sebagai pitra yadnya ( lontar yama purwana tattwa).Pitra yang artinya leluhur atau orang yang mati sedangkan yadnya adalah persembahan suci yang tulus ikhlas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pelaksanaan ritual upacara ngaben / Pitra Yadnya</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPACARA ATIWA-TIWA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asal kata Atiwa-tiwa: Ati = berkeinginan, Awa =&nbsp; terang atau bening atau bersih. Artinya: Keinginan melaksanakan pebersihan dan penyucian jenasah dan kekuatan Panca Maha buthanya. Atiwa-tiwa juga disebut upacara melelet atau upacara pengeringkesan. Merupakan upacara pebersihan dan penyucian secara permulaan thd jenasah dari kekuatan Panca Maha Butha. Dikenal dg Puja Pitara utk meningkatkan kesucian Petra menjadi Pitara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ngeringkes atau Ngelelet pengertiannya adalah pengembalian atau penyucian asal mula dari manusa yaitu berupa huruf2 suci sehingga harus dikembalikan lagi. Manusia lahir diberi kekuatan oleh Sang Hyang Widhi berupa Ongkara Mula, didalam jasad bermanifestasi menjadi Sastra Mudra, Sastra Wrestra (Nuriastra) dan Sastra Swalalita. Ketiga kekuatan sastra ini memberi makna Utpti, Stiti, Pralina (lahir, hidup, mati). Ketiga sastra ini kemudian bermanifestasi lagi memberi jiwa kepada setiap sel tubuh. Sebagai contoh Sastra Wrestra (Nuriastra) antara lain:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = kekuatan pada Ati Putih</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Na = kekuatan pada Nabi (pusar)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ca = cekoking gulu (ujung leher)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ra = tulang dada (tulang keris)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ka = pangrengan (telinga)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Da = dada</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ta = netra (mata)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sa = sebuku-buku (sendi)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wa = ulu hati&nbsp; (Madya)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. La = lambe (bibir)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Ma = cangkem (mulut)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. Ga = gigir (punggung)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. Ba = bahu (pangkal leher)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Nga = irung (hidung</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. Pa = pupu (paha)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16. Ja = jejaringan (penutup usus)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>17. Ya = ampru (empedu)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>18. Nya = smara (kama)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tubuh manusia memiliki 108 Sastra Dirga (huruf-huruf suci) yang pada waktu meninggal sastra2 itu dikembalikan ke sastra Ongkara Mula atau disebut Ongkara Pranawa. Proses pengembalian ini disebut Ngeringkes yang memerlukan upacara dan sarana. Atiwa-tiwa sudah merupakan pensucian tahap permulaan, sehingga setelah atiwa-tiwa jenasah sudah bisa digotong dinaikkan ke paga atau wadah. Jika dikubur tanpa atiwa-tiwa sesungguhnya jenasah tidak boleh digotong, tetapi dijinjing karena masih berstatus Petra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPAKARA ATIWA-TIWA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara Munggah di Kemulan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peras, soda, daksina, suci alit asoroh, tipat kelanan, canang suci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara Munggah di Surya</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peras, soda, daksina, tipat kelanan, canang pesucian</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara disamping jenasah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peras, soda, daksina. Tipat kelanan. Banten saji pitara asele. Peras pengambean, penyeneng, rantasan. Eteh-eteh pesucian, pengulapan, prayascita, bayekawonan. Banten isuh-isuh, lis degdeg (lis gede), bale gading (Kereb Akasa).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara Pepegatan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pejati asoroh, banten penyambutan pepegatan angiyu, sebuah lesung, segehan sasah 9 tanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara Pengiriman</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pejati lengkap 4 soroh (termasuk pekeling di Prajapati), Saji Pitra asele, punjung putih kuning, tipat pesor dan nasi angkeb, Peras Pengambean, segehan sasah 9 tanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara Pengentas Bambang</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pejati lengkap asoroh, tumpeng barak, soda barak ulam ayam biying mepanggang, prayascita, bayekawonan, pengulapan, segehan barak atanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara di Sanggah Cucuk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pejati asoroh, canang payasan, banten peras tulung sayut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JENIS UPACARA NGABEN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPACARA PENGABENAN NGEWANGUN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Semua organ tubuh (sebagai awangun) memperoleh material upakara sehingga upakaranya banyak. Ngaben jenis ini diikuti dengan Pengaskaran. Ada dua jenis: (1) Upacara Pengabenan mewangun Sawa Pratek Utama, ada jenasah atau watang matah.&nbsp; (2) Upacara Pengabenan mewangun Nyawa Wedana, tidak ada jenasah tetapi disimbulkan dengan&nbsp; adegan kayu cendana yang digambar dan ditulis aksara sangkanparan. Nyawa Wedana berasal dari kata Nyawa atau nyawang (dibuat simbul). Wedana = rupa atau wujud. Dengan demikian Nyawa Wedana artinya dibuatkan rupa2an (simbolis manusia).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPACARA PENGABENAN PRANAWA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pengabenan dengan sarana upakaranya ditujukan kepada 9 lobang yang ada pada diri manusia. Pranawa berasal dari kata Prana (lobang, nafas, jalan) dan Nawa (artinya 9). Kesembilan lobang yang dimaksud adalah:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Udana (lobang kening), mempengaruhi baik buruknya pikiran</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurma (lobang mata) mempengaruhi budhi baik atau buruk , terobos ke dasendriya</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krkara (lobang hidung), pengaruh Tri Kaya, jujur atau tidak4.Prana (mulut). Dosa bersumber dari mulut (Tri Mala Paksa)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhananjya (kerongkongan). Kekuatan mempengaruhi manah &ndash; sombong dan durhaka</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samana (lobang pepusuhan), pengaruh jiwa menjadi loba dan serakah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naga (lobang lambung)&nbsp; pengaruh karakter yang berkaitan dg Sad Ripu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wyana (lobang sendi) pengaruhi perbuatan memunculkan Subha Asubha Karma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apana (pantat&nbsp; kemaluan) pengaruhi kama yg berkaitan denga Sapta Timira.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kesembilan lobang manusia ini dapat mengantar manusia kelembah dosa. Pengabenan Pranawa juga diikuti dengan upacara pengaskaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ada lima jenis Pengabenan Pranawa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sawa Pranawa: Disertai jenasah atau watang matah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kusa Pranawa :&nbsp; dg watang matah atau hanya dengan adegan saja. Adegannya disertakan pengawak dari 100 katih ambengan. Memakai upacara pengaskaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toya Pranawa. Sama dg Kusa Pranawa, hanya didalam adegannya berisi payuk pere, berisi air dan dilengkapi dengan eteh2 pengentas. Juga memakai Pengaskaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gni Pranawa. Sama dengan pranawa lainnya, juga melakukan pengaskaran tapi pengaskaran nista yang dilakukan di setra setelah sawanya menjadi sekah tunggal. Tanpa uperengga seperti Damar kurung, tumpang salu, pepelengkungan, ancak saji, bale paga, tiga sampir, baju antakesuma, paying pagut. Hanya&nbsp; memakai dammar layon, peti jenasah dan pepaga/penusangan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sapta Pranawa. Upacara ini dilakukan dirumah, menggunakan damar kurung dan pengaskaran. Tapi tidak menggunakan Bale Paga pd waktu mengusung jenasah ke setra. Hanya menggunakan pepaga/penusanganb.&nbsp; juga dilaksanakan langsung di setra tapi pelaksanaan pengabenannya mapendem, serta pelaksanaan pengentasnya diata bambang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PENGABENAN SWASTHA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pengabenan sederhana, dengan tingkat terkecil&nbsp; karena tidak dengan pengaskaran. Berarti tidak menggunakan kajang, otomatis tanpa upacara Pengajuman Kajang. Tidak&nbsp; menggunakan bale paga, damar kurung, damar layon, damar angenan, petulangan, tiga sampir, baju antakesuma dan payung pagut. Hanya menggunakan peti jenasah&nbsp; dan Pepaga/penusangan untuk mengusung ke setra. Pelaksanaan upacara di setra saja. Pengabenan Swastha Geni ini sering rancu dengan pengabenan Geni Pranawa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swasta asal katanya &ldquo;su&rdquo; (luwih, utama). Astha berasal dari Asthi (tulang, abu). Dengan demikian Swastha berarti pengabenan kembali ke intinya tapi tetap memiliki nilai utama. Pengabenan swstha terdiri dua jenis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Swastha Geni. Penyelesaian di setra dengan cara membakar jenasah maupun tanpa jenasah. Hanya ada pelaksanaan &ldquo;pengiriman&rdquo; setelah dibuatkan bentuk sekah tunggal, kemudian dilanjutkan dengan upacara nganyut. Setelah itu selesai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Swastha Bambang. Semua runtutan pelaksanaannya upakaranya dilaksanakan di atas bambang penguburan jenasah. Kwantitas upakaranya sama dengan pengabenan Swastha Geni hanya saja dalam upakaranya ditambah dengan &ldquo;pengandeg bambang&rdquo;. Pengabenan swastha bambang ini tidak disertakan upacara pengerekan dan penganyutan , karena tidak dilakukan pembakaran melainkan dikubur. Sedangkan &ldquo;pengelemijian&rdquo; dan pengerorasan tetap dilaksanakan seperti ngaben biasa. Pengabenan Swastha Geni atau Swastha Bambang termasuk pengabenan nista utama, tidak memakai bale paga, tidak melaksanakan pengaskaran dan pada saat ke setra memakai tumpang salu saja.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Kerthi Parwa. Termasuk pengabenan tingkat nistaning utama. Dilakukan pada umat Hindu yang gugur di medan perang. Tidak dilakukan pengaskaran, hanya upacara ngentas dan pengiriman saja. Pelaksanaanya seperti pengabenan Swastha Geni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Ngelanus. Sebenarnya tidak termasuk bagian dari jenis pengabenan. Hanya teknisnya yang dibuat cepat. Ada dua jenis pengabenan ngelanus yaitu:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ngelanus Tandang Mantri. Pengabenan dan pemukuran diselesaikan dalam satu hari. Pengabenan ini mengacu pada sastra agama &ldquo;Lontar Kramaning Aben Ngelanus&rdquo;. Disebut juga dengan Pemargi Ngeluwer. Pengabenan ini hanya untuk para Wiku, tidak diperkenankan untuk walaka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ngelanus Tumandang Mantri. Dilakukan untuk walaka dalam kurun waktu satu sampai dua hari untuk para walaka . Upakara dan upacaranya tergantung kwantitas upakara dan upacaranya.</p>\r\n', 'ngaben.jpg', 'id', '2023-10-24 21:40:46', '2023-10-24 16:00:00'),
(2, 'Melasti', '<p><strong>Melasti</strong> adalah upacara pensucian diri untuk menyambut hari raya Nyepi oleh seluruh umat Hindu di Bali. Upacara Melasti digelar untuk menghanyutkan kotoran alam menggunakan air kehidupan.

(4, 'Ngaben in Bali', '<p>Ngaben adalah upacara pembakaran jenazah umat HIndu di Bali.Upacara ngaben merupakan suatu ritual yang dilaksanakan untuk mengembalikan roh leluhur ke tempat asalnya.Ngaben dalam bahasaBali berkonotasi halus yang sering disebut palebon.Palebon berasal dari kata lebu yang artinya prathiwi atau tanah.Palebon artinya menjadikan prathiwi (abu).Untuk menjadikan tanah itu ada dua cara yaitu dengan cara membakar (ngaben) dan menanam ke dalam tanah (metanem).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tujuan upacara ngaben</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tujuan dari upacara ngaben adalah mempercepat ragha sarira agar dapat kembali ke asalnya,yaitu panca maha buthadi alam ini dan bagi atma dapat cepat menuju alam pitra.landasan filosofis ngaben secara umum adalah panca sradha yaitu lima kerangka dasar Agama Hindu yaitu Brahman, Atman, Karmaphala, Samsara dan Moksa. Sedangkan secara khusus ngaben dilaksanakan karena wujud cinta kepada para leluhur dan bhakti anak kepada orang tuanya.Upacara ngaben merupakan proses pengembalian unsur panca maha butha kepada Sang pencipta. Ngaben juga disebut sebagai pitra yadnya ( lontar yama purwana tattwa).Pitra yang artinya leluhur atau orang yang mati sedangkan yadnya adalah persembahan suci yang tulus ikhlas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pelaksanaan ritual upacara ngaben / Pitra Yadnya</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPACARA ATIWA-TIWA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asal kata Atiwa-tiwa: Ati = berkeinginan, Awa =&nbsp; terang atau bening atau bersih. Artinya: Keinginan melaksanakan pebersihan dan penyucian jenasah dan kekuatan Panca Maha buthanya. Atiwa-tiwa juga disebut upacara melelet atau upacara pengeringkesan. Merupakan upacara pebersihan dan penyucian secara permulaan thd jenasah dari kekuatan Panca Maha Butha. Dikenal dg Puja Pitara utk meningkatkan kesucian Petra menjadi Pitara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ngeringkes atau Ngelelet pengertiannya adalah pengembalian atau penyucian asal mula dari manusa yaitu berupa huruf2 suci sehingga harus dikembalikan lagi. Manusia lahir diberi kekuatan oleh Sang Hyang Widhi berupa Ongkara Mula, didalam jasad bermanifestasi menjadi Sastra Mudra, Sastra Wrestra (Nuriastra) dan Sastra Swalalita. Ketiga kekuatan sastra ini memberi makna Utpti, Stiti, Pralina (lahir, hidup, mati). Ketiga sastra ini kemudian bermanifestasi lagi memberi jiwa kepada setiap sel tubuh. Sebagai contoh Sastra Wrestra (Nuriastra) antara lain:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = kekuatan pada Ati Putih</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Na = kekuatan pada Nabi (pusar)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ca = cekoking gulu (ujung leher)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ra = tulang dada (tulang keris)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ka = pangrengan (telinga)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Da = dada</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ta = netra (mata)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sa = sebuku-buku (sendi)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wa = ulu hati&nbsp; (Madya)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. La = lambe (bibir)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Ma = cangkem (mulut)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. Ga = gigir (punggung)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. Ba = bahu (pangkal leher)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Nga = irung (hidung</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. Pa = pupu (paha)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16. Ja = jejaringan (penutup usus)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>17. Ya = ampru (empedu)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>18. Nya = smara (kama)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tubuh manusia memiliki 108 Sastra Dirga (huruf-huruf suci) yang pada waktu meninggal sastra2 itu dikembalikan ke sastra Ongkara Mula atau disebut Ongkara Pranawa. Proses pengembalian ini disebut Ngeringkes yang memerlukan upacara dan sarana. Atiwa-tiwa sudah merupakan pensucian tahap permulaan, sehingga setelah atiwa-tiwa jenasah sudah bisa digotong dinaikkan ke paga atau wadah. Jika dikubur tanpa atiwa-tiwa sesungguhnya jenasah tidak boleh digotong, tetapi dijinjing karena masih berstatus Petra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPAKARA ATIWA-TIWA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara Munggah di Kemulan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peras, soda, daksina, suci alit asoroh, tipat kelanan, canang suci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara Munggah di Surya</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peras, soda, daksina, tipat kelanan, canang pesucian</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upakara disamping jenasah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peras, soda, daksina.

Ngaben jenis ini diikuti dengan Pengaskaran. Ada dua jenis: (1) Upacara Pengabenan mewangun Sawa Pratek Utama, ada jenasah atau watang matah.&nbsp; (2) Upacara Pengabenan mewangun Nyawa Wedana, tidak ada jenasah tetapi disimbulkan dengan&nbsp; adegan kayu cendana yang digambar dan ditulis aksara sangkanparan. Nyawa Wedana berasal dari kata Nyawa atau nyawang (dibuat simbul). Wedana = rupa atau wujud. Dengan demikian Nyawa Wedana artinya dibuatkan rupa2an (simbolis manusia).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPACARA PENGABENAN PRANAWA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pengabenan dengan sarana upakaranya ditujukan kepada 9 lobang yang ada pada diri manusia. Pranawa berasal dari kata Prana (lobang, nafas, jalan) dan Nawa (artinya 9). Kesembilan lobang yang dimaksud adalah:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Udana (lobang kening), mempengaruhi baik buruknya pikiran</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurma (lobang mata) mempengaruhi budhi baik atau buruk , terobos ke dasendriya</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krkara (lobang hidung), pengaruh Tri Kaya, jujur atau tidak4.Prana (mulut).

Pengabenan Pranawa juga diikuti dengan upacara pengaskaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ada lima jenis Pengabenan Pranawa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sawa Pranawa: Disertai jenasah atau watang matah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kusa Pranawa :&nbsp; dg watang matah atau hanya dengan adegan saja. Adegannya disertakan pengawak dari 100 katih ambengan. Memakai upacara pengaskaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toya Pranawa. Sama dg Kusa Pranawa, hanya didalam adegannya berisi payuk pere, berisi air dan dilengkapi dengan eteh2 pengentas. Juga memakai Pengaskaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gni Pranawa. Sama dengan pranawa lainnya, juga melakukan pengaskaran tapi pengaskaran nista yang dilakukan di setra setelah sawanya menjadi sekah tunggal. Tanpa uperengga seperti Damar kurung, tumpang salu, pepelengkungan, ancak saji, bale paga, tiga sampir, baju antakesuma, paying pagut. Hanya&nbsp; memakai dammar layon, peti jenasah dan pepaga/penusangan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sapta Pranawa. Upacara ini dilakukan dirumah, menggunakan damar kurung dan pengaskaran. Tapi tidak menggunakan Bale Paga pd waktu mengusung jenasah ke setra. Hanya menggunakan pepaga/penusanganb.&nbsp; juga dilaksanakan langsung di setra tapi pelaksanaan pengabenannya mapendem, serta pelaksanaan pengentasnya diata bambang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PENGABENAN SWASTHA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pengabenan sederhana, dengan tingkat terkecil&nbsp; karena tidak dengan pengaskaran. Berarti tidak menggunakan kajang, otomatis tanpa upacara Pengajuman Kajang. Tidak&nbsp; menggunakan bale paga, damar kurung, damar layon, damar angenan, petulangan, tiga sampir, baju antakesuma dan payung pagut. Hanya menggunakan peti jenasah&nbsp; dan Pepaga/penusangan untuk mengusung ke setra. Pelaksanaan upacara di setra saja. Pengabenan Swastha Geni ini sering rancu dengan pengabenan Geni Pranawa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swasta asal katanya &ldquo;su&rdquo; (luwih, utama). Astha berasal dari Asthi (tulang, abu). Dengan demikian Swastha berarti pengabenan kembali ke intinya tapi tetap memiliki nilai utama. Pengabenan swstha terdiri dua jenis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Swastha Geni. Penyelesaian di setra dengan cara membakar jenasah maupun tanpa jenasah. Hanya ada pelaksanaan &ldquo;pengiriman&rdquo; setelah dibuatkan bentuk sekah tunggal, kemudian dilanjutkan dengan upacara nganyut. Setelah itu selesai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Swastha Bambang. Semua runtutan pelaksanaannya upakaranya dilaksanakan di atas bambang penguburan jenasah. Kwantitas upakaranya sama dengan pengabenan Swastha Geni hanya saja dalam upakaranya ditambah dengan &ldquo;pengandeg bambang&rdquo;. Pengabenan swastha bambang ini tidak disertakan upacara pengerekan dan penganyutan , karena tidak dilakukan pembakaran melainkan dikubur. Sedangkan &ldquo;pengelemijian&rdquo; dan pengerorasan tetap dilaksanakan seperti ngaben biasa. Pengabenan Swastha Geni atau Swastha Bambang termasuk pengabenan nista utama, tidak memakai bale paga, tidak melaksanakan pengaskaran dan pada saat ke setra memakai tumpang salu saja.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Kerthi Parwa. Termasuk pengabenan tingkat nistaning utama. Dilakukan pada umat Hindu yang gugur di medan perang. Tidak dilakukan pengaskaran, hanya upacara ngentas dan pengiriman saja. Pelaksanaanya seperti pengabenan Swastha Geni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pengabenan Ngelanus. Sebenarnya tidak termasuk bagian dari jenis pengabenan. Hanya teknisnya yang dibuat cepat. Ada dua jenis pengabenan ngelanus yaitu:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ngelanus Tandang Mantri. Pengabenan dan pemukuran diselesaikan dalam satu hari. Pengabenan ini mengacu pada sastra agama &ldquo;Lontar Kramaning Aben Ngelanus&rdquo;. Disebut juga dengan Pemargi Ngeluwer. Pengabenan ini hanya untuk para Wiku, tidak diperkenankan untuk walaka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ngelanus Tumandang Mantri. Dilakukan untuk walaka dalam kurun waktu satu sampai dua hari untuk para walaka . Upakara dan upacaranya tergantung kwantitas upakara dan upacaranya.</p>\r\n', 'ngaben.jpg', 'en', '2023-10-24 21:40:46', '2023-10-24 16:00:00'),

At the beginning of the 18th century, the Dutch opened commercial plantations in their colonies in the Dutch East Indies, especially on the islands of Java and Sumatra. One of them is an Arabica coffee plantation with seeds imported from Yemen. During the era of &ldquo;Forced Cultivation&rdquo; or Cultuurstelsel (1830-1870), the Dutch forbade native plantation workers from picking coffee fruit for personal consumption, but local people wanted to try the famous coffee drink. Then the plantation worker finally discovered that there was a kind of ferret that liked to eat coffee, but only the flesh was digested, the epidermis and the coffee beans were intact and undigested. The coffee beans in the civet droppings are then picked up, washed, roasted, ground, then brewed with hot water to create civet coffee.[2] The news about the enjoyment of this aromatic coffee finally reached the Dutch owners of the plantations, so this coffee became a favorite of the Dutch rich. Due to its rarity and the unusual manufacturing process, luwak coffee has been an expensive coffee since colonial times</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bali Agrotourism</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bali is well-known for its stunning tourist attractions, but it is also well-known for its agrotourism. Agrotourism refers to a business that is involved in the plantation sector, and in this case, it is typically referred to as a location for producing chocolate, varied coffee, and famous civet coffee, also known as Luwak Coffee. Previously, there was only one location that produced and sold civet coffee; however, this agrotourism business has expanded, and there are now other locations that sell and manufacture civet coffee, the most of which are placed beside the tourism route. Bali Coffee Luwak has a very smooth flavor with no bitterness and a subtle refreshing fruit acid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>History of Coffee Luwak</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind the mythology of Coffee Luwak comes a distinct history. The Dutch built coffee plantations on the volcanic islands of the Dutch East Indies in the early 18th century. This Arabica Coffee Luwak comes from the mythical island of Bali. Initially, Dutch Coffee Plantation owners prohibited local indigenous from gathering and boiling coffee beans for personal consumption. Being resourceful, the indigenous people quickly found that the asian palm civet preferred eating coffee beans. These Luwak beans were harvested, cleaned, sun dried, and roasted to create a coffee with a deep richness but no acidity. The action of passing the bean through the civet&rsquo;s digestive tract chemically modifies the proteins in the Coffee Luwak bean, yielding more complex and smooth flavors, not present in typical coffees. Since then, civet coffee has not been as thriving as it is now, with the beginning of the civet coffee boom occurring around 2011-2012, when there was only one location, and since then, many guests have been there, and through word of mouth and social media, this coffee plantation has become very famous, and entrepreneurs seize this opportunity and start many coffee plantations along the strategic route passed by tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Process Making Coffee Luwak</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The resulting&nbsp;<strong>Bali Coffee Luwak</strong>&nbsp;is said to be like no other in the world (literally). It has a rich, heavy flavor with hints of caramel and/or chocolate. Other terms used to describe it are earthy, musty and exotic. The body can be syrupy and it&rsquo;s the smoothest coffee you will ever have.The taste of civet coffee is very complete and will certainly nourish your body, on the island of Bali there are many places already available for civet coffee, and there are also many local companies that produce civet coffee with very good quality. So if you are on a tour and in the lapse of time you can stop for a moment at local coffee shops in tourism areas to try and taste this civet coffee. Luwak coffee taste is indeed very difficult to express, for those of you who are not coffee lovers, you may feel a slight difference, namely the taste is very smooth and not biting, but for coffee lovers, they can feel more, where many flavors are mixed into one and also the taste is very smooth and not like the usual coffee. For coffee lovers, this difference in taste is very pronounced. If you really like coffee, it would be nice if you try this luwak coffee and feel the difference with regular coffee</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coffee Luwak Business</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the development of agro-tourism on the island of Bali, many entrepreneurs have opened this civet or luwak coffee business, most of which are located on the tourist route that is often visited. Because the process of making coffee is rather complicated and produces not much coffee in one production, the price of civet coffee is quite expensive compared to ordinary coffee.&nbsp;<strong>Bali Civet Coffee</strong>&nbsp;goes through a longer process flow before it reaches your cup. Because the process is different, the taste and content in this civet coffee will certainly not be the same as regular coffee. At first glance, there is nothing different about this drink, the color produced is the same as usual coffee, brownish black. However, when it comes to aroma and taste, it&rsquo;s certainly not the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Try Coffee Luwak at Coffee Plantation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are on vacation on the island of Bali and you are a coffee fans, it would be nice if you try a cup of this Bali Coffee Luwak. And also many Bali Coffee Luwak cafes provide places with great views to enjoy a cup of coffee. For the price of a pack of Coffee Luwak, it may be very expensive, but you can only try one cup of coffee luwak that has been brewed at a relatively affordable price.

At the beginning of the 18th century, the Dutch opened commercial plantations in their colonies in the Dutch East Indies, especially on the islands of Java and Sumatra. One of them is an Arabica coffee plantation with seeds imported from Yemen. During the era of &ldquo;Forced Cultivation&rdquo; or Cultuurstelsel (1830-1870), the Dutch forbade native plantation workers from picking coffee fruit for personal consumption, but local people wanted to try the famous coffee drink. Then the plantation worker finally discovered that there was a kind of ferret that liked to eat coffee, but only the flesh was digested, the epidermis and the coffee beans were intact and undigested. The coffee beans in the civet droppings are then picked up, washed, roasted, ground, then brewed with hot water to create civet coffee.[2] The news about the enjoyment of this aromatic coffee finally reached the Dutch owners of the plantations, so this coffee became a favorite of the Dutch rich. Due to its rarity and the unusual manufacturing process, luwak coffee has been an expensive coffee since colonial times</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bali Agrotourism</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bali is well-known for its stunning tourist attractions, but it is also well-known for its agrotourism. Agrotourism refers to a business that is involved in the plantation sector, and in this case, it is typically referred to as a location for producing chocolate, varied coffee, and famous civet coffee, also known as Luwak Coffee. Previously, there was only one location that produced and sold civet coffee; however, this agrotourism business has expanded, and there are now other locations that sell and manufacture civet coffee, the most of which are placed beside the tourism route. Bali Coffee Luwak has a very smooth flavor with no bitterness and a subtle refreshing fruit acid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>History of Coffee Luwak</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind the mythology of Coffee Luwak comes a distinct history. The Dutch built coffee plantations on the volcanic islands of the Dutch East Indies in the early 18th century. This Arabica Coffee Luwak comes from the mythical island of Bali. Initially, Dutch Coffee Plantation owners prohibited local indigenous from gathering and boiling coffee beans for personal consumption. Being resourceful, the indigenous people quickly found that the asian palm civet preferred eating coffee beans. These Luwak beans were harvested, cleaned, sun dried, and roasted to create a coffee with a deep richness but no acidity. The action of passing the bean through the civet&rsquo;s digestive tract chemically modifies the proteins in the Coffee Luwak bean, yielding more complex and smooth flavors, not present in typical coffees. Since then, civet coffee has not been as thriving as it is now, with the beginning of the civet coffee boom occurring around 2011-2012, when there was only one location, and since then, many guests have been there, and through word of mouth and social media, this coffee plantation has become very famous, and entrepreneurs seize this opportunity and start many coffee plantations along the strategic route passed by tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Process Making Coffee Luwak</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The resulting&nbsp;<strong>Bali Coffee Luwak</strong>&nbsp;is said to be like no other in the world (literally). It has a rich, heavy flavor with hints of caramel and/or chocolate. Other terms used to describe it are earthy, musty and exotic. The body can be syrupy and it&rsquo;s the smoothest coffee you will ever have.The taste of civet coffee is very complete and will certainly nourish your body, on the island of Bali there are many places already available for civet coffee, and there are also many local companies that produce civet coffee with very good quality. So if you are on a tour and in the lapse of time you can stop for a moment at local coffee shops in tourism areas to try and taste this civet coffee. Luwak coffee taste is indeed very difficult to express, for those of you who are not coffee lovers, you may feel a slight difference, namely the taste is very smooth and not biting, but for coffee lovers, they can feel more, where many flavors are mixed into one and also the taste is very smooth and not like the usual coffee. For coffee lovers, this difference in taste is very pronounced. If you really like coffee, it would be nice if you try this luwak coffee and feel the difference with regular coffee</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coffee Luwak Business</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the development of agro-tourism on the island of Bali, many entrepreneurs have opened this civet or luwak coffee business, most of which are located on the tourist route that is often visited. Because the process of making coffee is rather complicated and produces not much coffee in one production, the price of civet coffee is quite expensive compared to ordinary coffee.&nbsp;<strong>Bali Civet Coffee</strong>&nbsp;goes through a longer process flow before it reaches your cup. Because the process is different, the taste and content in this civet coffee will certainly not be the same as regular coffee. At first glance, there is nothing different about this drink, the color produced is the same as usual coffee, brownish black. However, when it comes to aroma and taste, it&rsquo;s certainly not the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Try Coffee Luwak at Coffee Plantation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are on vacation on the island of Bali and you are a coffee fans, it would be nice if you try a cup of this Bali Coffee Luwak. And also many Bali Coffee Luwak cafes provide places with great views to enjoy a cup of coffee. For the price of a pack of Coffee Luwak, it may be very expensive, but you can only try one cup of coffee luwak that has been brewed at a relatively affordable price. We from&nbsp;<strong>Bali Tours</strong>&nbsp;are ready to take you by providing private transportation with an experienced driver to the famous civet coffee place, while watching the process of making Bali Coffee Luwak directly and enjoying a cup of civet coffee with amazing natural views.

The Nusa Dua tourist attraction is unique in that we can see waves breaking against the rock and making a beautiful sound as well as splashes of water onto the rock. The wind-blown coral is both refreshing and calming. It is recommended to visit this tourist attraction while on vacation on the island of Bali to try something new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Location of Water Blow Nusa Dua</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The waterblow location is in Nusa Dua, precisely in south Bali and behind the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (a five-star hotel complex located in Nusa Dua), more precisely behind the Grand Hyatt Bali hotel. If you are from Kuta it only takes 20-30 minutes to reach this location, rely on google map so you don&rsquo;t get lost and on every road to this place there are already road signs, so you won&rsquo;t be confused in finding the location of the Water Blow natural phenomenon. this is very thrilling, here don&rsquo;t get too close to the cliff because it is very dangerous, stay in the prepared place</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water Blow Nusa Dua Facility</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facilities at the location of this water blow tourism object are classified as very complete, where a place is provided to see the waterblow view from afar, and the BTDC has equipped this place with a gazebo for those of you who want to take shelter while seeing the uniqueness of this wave tour, there is a magnificent restaurant here with a variety of seafood dishes that you might be able to visit while enjoying the beautiful waves of this waterblow. Even though it&rsquo;s called water blow beach, but here there is no beach sand, but only rocks that are here, the rocks that are constantly being eroded by waves make the shape of the rocks very irregular and maybe this shape is very natural to use as a photo object for those of you who want to capture the moment in this Water Blow</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular Water Blow In South Bali</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Water Blow tourism object since it was just introduced has become a prima donna in the hearts of tourists who want to see this wave tour, in addition to wave tourism you can see the vast and magnificent expanse of the Indian Ocean, while sitting in the gazebo and admiring this phenomenal work of nature will make you happy. you feel calm and comfortable, feel like you want to linger here, although it is very exciting but also very risky, don&rsquo;t go near the cliff where the waves hit, because there have been several cases where tourists are dragged by the waves in this water blow because they don&rsquo;t heed the prohibition not to approaching the cliff, so be careful and always obey the rules here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water Blow Nusa Dua Safety</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for water blow, it is a tourist attraction which may be a little dangerous, therefore the managers of this tour make it very comfortable to visit by installing a guardrail along this rock, so it is hoped that tourists who visit do not get out of the boundary area, the guardrail is made of concrete so it is very to go through. In our opinion, security is very guaranteed as long as you know all the rules here, namely never go outside the barrier that is here. With this level of security, visitors feel comfortable and calm and are not afraid of being hit by the waves, because the guardrail is located some distance from the rock cliffs that were hit by the sea waves.<br />\r\nin the waterblow area in front there is a gate made of limestone with the name Water Blow inscribed and next to the gate there is a memorial stone made so that tourists are aware of the rules and warnings when visiting this water blow tourist attraction, as for the memorial stone that reads like this</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>No Swimming.</li>\r\n	<li>Dangerous Waves.</li>\r\n	<li>High Waves.</li>\r\n	<li>Steep cliff.</li>\r\n	<li>Slippery Rock.</li>\r\n	<li>Sharp Coral.</li>\r\n	<li>Strong current.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>so it is expected that tourists who visit this water blow tourism object to comply with all the rules, because this tourist attraction is quite extreme and to prevent things that we do not want together, please obey the rules here</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Time to Visit Water Blow Nusa Dua</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best time to visit water blow is during the day where you can see the waves hitting the rocks very clearly, but during the day it might feel a bit hot for you but compared to the results the photos produced are very appropriate, very Instagram once the photos are produced by this water blow tourist attraction.

With all of the caves and coves, beach bars, and spectacular surf conditions, this place is also known as Blue Point Beach and Suluban Beach Bali. Suluban Beach is well-known for its incredible waves, which draw a large number of surfers to the Uluwatu area.

The best way to get here is on your rental motorbike. You can easily rent motorbikes in all the main tourist areas such as Uluwatu, Seminyak, Kuta, Canggu and Ubud. Make sure to have an international drivers license and always wear a helmet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suluban beach entrance fee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two entrances to Suluban beach Uluwatu. We always took the Single Fin entrance, and via both ways you need to walk down for about 10 minutes until you reach the beach. The beach is free to enter, but there is a parking fee at both parkings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beach entrance parking fee: 3,000 IDR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Single Fin entrance parking fee: 5,000 IDR for a motorbike / 15,000 IDR for a car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best time to visit Suluban beach</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best time to visit Bali Suluban beach is during low tide.

It&rsquo;s also easier and safer to access and explore the Suluban Cave beach with its small rock openings that lead to the hidden beach with low tide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sunset in south Bali is stunning, so if you&rsquo;re a sunset lover make sure to get here on time!

You can find this story carved into stone relief, placed in GWK Street Theater. The story of Garuda birth and deeds is told in the first book of the great epic Mahabharata. According to the epic, when Garuda first burst forth from his egg, he appeared as a raging inferno equal to the cosmic conflagration that consumes the world at the end of every age. Frightened, the gods begged him for mercy. Garuda, hearing their plea, reduced himself in size and energy. Garuda father was the creator-rishi Kasyapa. His mother was Vinata, whose sister was Kadru, the mother of serpents. One day, Vinata entered into and lost a foolish bet, as a result of which she became enslaved to her sister. Mahabharata mentions about a bet between sisters and wives of Kashyapa, Vinata and Kadru, about the colour of Uchchaihshravas tail. While Vinata, the mother of Garuda and Aruna, said it was white, Kadru said it was black. The loser would have to serve as a servant of the winner. Kadru told her sons, Naga (&ldquo;serpent&rdquo;), to cover the tail of the horse and thus make it appear as black in colour and thus, Kadru won.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resolving to release his mother from this state of bondage, Garuda approached the serpents and asked them what it would take to purchase her freedom. Their reply was that Garuda would have to bring them the elixir of immortality, also called amrita. It was a tall order. The amrita at that time found itself in the possession of the gods, who guarded it jealously, since it was the source of their immortality. They had ringed the elixir with a massive fire that covered the sky. They had blocked the way to the elixir with a fierce mechanical contraption of sharp rotating blades. And finally, they had stationed two gigantic poisonous snakes next to the elixir as deadly guardians. Undaunted, Garuda hastened toward the abode of the gods intent on robbing them of their treasure. Knowing of his design, the gods met him in full battle-array. Garuda, however, defeated the entire host and scattered them in all directions. Taking the water of many rivers into his mouth, he extinguished the protective fire the gods had thrown up. Reducing his size, he crept past the rotating blades of their murderous machine. And finally, he mangled the two gigantic serpents they had posted as guards. Taking the elixir into his mouth without swallowing it, he launched again into the air and headed toward the eagerly waiting serpents. En route, he encountered Vishnu. Rather than fight, the two exchanged promises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vishnu promised Garuda the gift of immortality even without drinking from the elixir, and Garuda promised to become Vishnu mount. Flying onward, he met Indra the god of the sky. Another exchange of promises occurred. Garuda promised that once he had delivered the elixir, thus fulfilling the request of the serpents, he would make it possible for Indra to regain possession of the elixir and to take it back to the gods. Indra in turn promised Garuda the serpents as food. At long last, Garuda alighted in front of the waiting serpents. Placing the elixir on the grass, and thereby liberating his mother Vinata from her servitude, he urged the serpents to perform their religious ablutions before consuming it. As they hurried off to do so, Indra swooped in to make off with the elixir. From that day onward, Garuda was the ally of the gods and the trusty mount of Vishnu, as well as the implacable enemy of snakes, upon whom he preyed at every opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garuda Wisnu Kencana Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garuda Wisnu Kencana is a tourist destination that has a very large area, where this gwk functions as a cultural park, where you can see various arts from the island of Bali and there is also a large yard as a place for picnics and recreation for family and friends.

You can find this story carved into stone relief, placed in GWK Street Theater. The story of Garuda birth and deeds is told in the first book of the great epic Mahabharata. According to the epic, when Garuda first burst forth from his egg, he appeared as a raging inferno equal to the cosmic conflagration that consumes the world at the end of every age. Frightened, the gods begged him for mercy. Garuda, hearing their plea, reduced himself in size and energy. Garuda father was the creator-rishi Kasyapa. His mother was Vinata, whose sister was Kadru, the mother of serpents. One day, Vinata entered into and lost a foolish bet, as a result of which she became enslaved to her sister. Mahabharata mentions about a bet between sisters and wives of Kashyapa, Vinata and Kadru, about the colour of Uchchaihshravas tail. While Vinata, the mother of Garuda and Aruna, said it was white, Kadru said it was black. The loser would have to serve as a servant of the winner. Kadru told her sons, Naga (&ldquo;serpent&rdquo;), to cover the tail of the horse and thus make it appear as black in colour and thus, Kadru won.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resolving to release his mother from this state of bondage, Garuda approached the serpents and asked them what it would take to purchase her freedom. Their reply was that Garuda would have to bring them the elixir of immortality, also called amrita. It was a tall order. The amrita at that time found itself in the possession of the gods, who guarded it jealously, since it was the source of their immortality. They had ringed the elixir with a massive fire that covered the sky. They had blocked the way to the elixir with a fierce mechanical contraption of sharp rotating blades. And finally, they had stationed two gigantic poisonous snakes next to the elixir as deadly guardians. Undaunted, Garuda hastened toward the abode of the gods intent on robbing them of their treasure. Knowing of his design, the gods met him in full battle-array. Garuda, however, defeated the entire host and scattered them in all directions.

I Gusti Agung Putu first built a taman ayun temple to the north of Mengwi hamlet to worship his ancestors. Genter Park was the name given to the shrine. When Mengwi evolved into a large kingdom, I Gusti Agung Putu expanded Genter Park to the east.

Until today, a piodalan (ceremony) is held in this temple to commemorate the temple&rsquo;s anniversary on Kliwon Tuesday of wuku Medangsia in the Javanese calendar (Saka). The purpose and goal of the king&rsquo;s establishment of these temples is for him and the people of the Mengwi kingdom to seek blessings for the safety, welfare, and fertility of the land. Also, to provide all Mengwi people with the opportunity to engage in religious rites at the Taman Ayun temple, such as teaching and learning, mendak sangpitara, nunas pekuluh (holy water) to destroy pests in the fields, and others.
